{1 PolderCast: P2P Topic-based Pub/Sub}

This is an OCaml implementation of PolderCast,
a P2P topic-based pub/sub protocol described in the paper
{{:https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01555561} PolderCast: Fast, Robust, and Scalable Architecture for P2P Topic-Based Pub/Sub}

It relies on three different gossip protocols:
- Random Peer Sampling, to find random nodes in the network. See the {!P2p_cyclon}module.
- Clustering, to find nodes with overlapping subscriptions. See the {!P2p_vicinity} module.
- Dissemination, for the dissemination of messages within a topic. See the {!P2p_ringcast} module.

{2 Privacy}

PolderCast, as specified in the paper, employs VICINITY for clustering,
and transmits full node subscription profiles in the clear.
See {{:https://github.com/p2pcollab/ocaml-blip} BLIP} for a privacy mechanism
that transmits subscriptions as randomized Bloom filters instead,
and {{:https://github.com/p2pcollab/ocaml-psi} BFPSI},
a Bloom filter-based Private Set Intersection protocol
to determine common subscriptions of two nodes.
