{1 RingCast: P2P hybrid dissemination protocol}

This is an OCaml implementation of RingCast,
a P2P hybrid (probabilistic/deterministic) dissemination protocol
described in the paper
{{:https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01555561} PolderCast}
(and earlier in
{{:https://www.distributed-systems.net/my-data/papers/2007.mw.pdf}
Hybrid Dissemination}.

It organizes nodes in a bidirectional ring structure
and forwards messages to neighbours as well as random nodes.
It achieves complete dissemination of messages with a low message overhead.
