{1 CYCLON: Inexpensive Membership Management for Unstructured P2P Overlays}

This is an OCaml implementation of the CYCLON protocol as specified in the paper
{{:https://www.distributed-systems.net/my-data/papers/2005.jnsm.pdf}
CYCLON: Inexpensive Membership Managementfor Unstructured P2P Overlays}.

{2 Protocol}

+ Increase by one the age of all neighbors.
+ Select neighbor {e Q} with the highest age among all neighbors, and {e l - 1} other random neighbors.
+ Replace {e Q}'s entry with a new entry of age 0 and with {e P}'s address.
+ Send the updated subset to peer {e Q}.
+ Receive from {e Q} a subset of no more that {e i} of its own entries.
+ Discard entries pointing at {e P} and entries already contained in {e P}'s cache.
+ Update {e P}'s cache to include {e all} remaining entries, by {e firstly} using empty cache slots (if any),
  and {e secondly} replacing entries among the ones sent to {e Q}.

{e Quoted from the paper above.}

{2 Security}

CYCLON is not secure against malicious nodes deviating from the protocol.
See {{:https://github.com/p2pcollab/ocaml-urps} URPS} for a stream sampler
implementation that achieves uniformity in presence of malicious nodes
and which can be used together with CYCLON.
